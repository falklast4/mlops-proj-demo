## Limitations & Risks

### Known Limitations
1. **Language**: English only - performance degrades significantly on other languages
2. **Domain**: Optimized for product/service reviews - may not generalize to other domains
3. **Length**: Performance may degrade on very short (<10 words) or very long (>512 tokens) texts
4. **Sarcasm**: Limited ability to detect sarcasm and irony
5. **Context**: Cannot understand context beyond the single input text

### Potential Biases
1. **Demographic Bias**: Training data may not represent all demographic groups equally
2. **Temporal Bias**: Model trained on historical data may not reflect current language patterns
3. **Domain Bias**: Overrepresentation of certain product categories in training data
4. **Length Bias**: May perform differently on texts of varying lengths

### Risk Mitigation
- Regular model retraining with updated data
- Continuous monitoring for bias and drift
- Human review for high-stakes decisions
- Confidence threshold implementation
- Regular evaluation on diverse test sets

## Ethical Considerations

### Fairness
- Model performance should be monitored across different demographic groups
- Regular bias audits should be conducted
- Decision thresholds may need adjustment for fairness

### Privacy
- Model does not store input text after processing
- All data handling follows GDPR/CCPA compliance
- No personal information is extracted or retained

### Transparency
- Model predictions include confidence scores
- Prediction explanations available through attention visualization
- Clear documentation of model limitations provided to users

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Performance Monitoring
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Monthly evaluation on held-out test set
- **Latency Monitoring**: Real-time P95 latency tracking
- **Drift Detection**: Weekly data distribution analysis
- **Bias Monitoring**: Quarterly fairness metric evaluation

### Maintenance Schedule
- **Retraining**: Monthly with new data
- **Evaluation**: Weekly performance assessment
- **Updates**: Quarterly model architecture review
- **Security**: Regular vulnerability scanning

### Alerts & Thresholds
- **Accuracy Drop**: Alert if accuracy falls below 85%
- **Latency Spike**: Alert if P95 latency exceeds 500ms
- **Drift Detection**: Alert if data drift score > 0.3
- **Error Rate**: Alert if error rate exceeds 5%
